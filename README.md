## Description
Repository to study the following Lenguaje C Topic: Sorting Algorithms and Big O

- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm
